# AI Text-to-Image Generator

This is a simple project that uses **Stable Diffusion v1.5** to generate images based on a text prompt.
It uses the `diffusers` library from Hugging Face and provides a user-friendly web interface using Gradio.

How It Works

- The user types a prompt like: *"A person sits on top of a hill watching the city at night"*
- The AI generates a corresponding image
- The image is displayed and can be downloaded

Tools Used

- Python
- Hugging Face Diffusers
- Gradio
- Google Colab (GPU)

How to Run

1. Open `text_to_image.ipynb` in Google Colab
2. Enable GPU: `Runtime` > `Change runtime type` > `GPU`
3. Run the cells
4. Use the Gradio interface to generate and download images

Example Prompts
- "A futuristic city glowing under the stars"
- "A dragon flying through storm clouds"
- "A cozy cabin in a snowy forest at night"
